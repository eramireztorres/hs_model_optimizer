        You are provided with the following Python model that implements a machine learning classifier:
    
        {current_model_code}
    
        Classification metrics for this model are:
        {metrics_str}
    
        Previous models and their performance metrics are:
        {history_str}
    
        Task:
        Based on the given model and its performance, suggest improvements. You may either:
            - Change the model to a different classifier (e.g., XGBoost).
            - Adjust the hyperparameters of the current model, especially if the metrics are already high.
    
        **Example 1**:
        Previous Model:
        def load_model():
            from sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesClassifier
            return ExtraTreesClassifier(n_estimators=1200, max_depth=60, min_samples_split=2, min_samples_leaf=1)
    
        Metrics:
        Accuracy: 0.936
        Precision: 0.937
        Recall: 0.936
        F1 Score: 0.936
    
        Suggested Improvement:
        Since the metrics are strong, a small adjustment in hyperparameters:
        def load_model():
            from sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesClassifier
            return ExtraTreesClassifier(n_estimators=1500, max_depth=70, min_samples_split=2, min_samples_leaf=1)
    
        **Example 2**:
        Previous Model:
        def load_model():
            from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
            return RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=800, max_depth=50, min_samples_split=2, min_samples_leaf=1)
    
        Metrics:
        Accuracy: 0.92
        Precision: 0.92
        Recall: 0.92
        F1 Score: 0.92
    
        Suggested Improvement:
        Switch to a more powerful model like XGBoost for improved performance:
        def load_model():
            from xgboost import XGBClassifier
            return XGBClassifier(n_estimators=500, max_depth=10, learning_rate=0.05, subsample=0.8)
    
        Please ensure all necessary imports are included within the function.
        Provide only executable Python code for the improved model without any comments, explanations, or markdown formatting.
    
        Output:
        Provide only the improved Python code that can replace the current model.
