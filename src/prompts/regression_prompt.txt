        You are provided with the following Python regression model:
    
        {current_model_code}
    
        Regression metrics for this model are:
        {metrics_str}
    
        Previous regression models and their performance metrics are:
        {history_str}
    
        Task:
        Based on the given regression model and its performance, suggest improvements. You may either:
            - Change the regression model to a different one (e.g., XGBRegressor).
            - Adjust the hyperparameters of the current regression model, especially if the metrics are already strong.
    
        **Example 1**:
        Previous Model:
        def load_model():
            from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
            return LinearRegression()
    
        Metrics:
        Mean Squared Error: 250.75
        R^2 Score: 0.85
    
        Suggested Improvement:
        Since the performance is decent but could be improved, switch to a more powerful model like XGBRegressor:
        def load_model():
            from xgboost import XGBRegressor
            return XGBRegressor(n_estimators=100, max_depth=5, learning_rate=0.1)
    
        **Example 2**:
        Previous Model:
        def load_model():
            from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
            return RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=500, max_depth=50)
    
        Metrics:
        Mean Squared Error: 200.5
        R^2 Score: 0.90
    
        Suggested Improvement:
        Since the model is already performing well, adjust the hyperparameters slightly for potential improvements:
        def load_model():
            from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
            return RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=700, max_depth=60, min_samples_split=5)
    
        Please ensure all necessary imports are included within the function.
        Provide only executable Python code for the improved regression model without any comments, explanations, or markdown formatting.
    
        Output:
        Provide only the improved Python code that can replace the current model.
