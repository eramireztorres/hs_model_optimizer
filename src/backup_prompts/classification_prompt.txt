**Example 1** (Strong Metrics, Small Hyperparameter Tuning):
Previous Model:
def load_model():
    from sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesClassifier
    return ExtraTreesClassifier(n_estimators=1200, max_depth=60, min_samples_split=2, min_samples_leaf=1)

Metrics:
    Global:
        Accuracy: 0.936
        Precision: 0.937
        Recall: 0.936
        F1 Score: 0.936
    Per-Class:
        Precision per class: [0.94, 0.92]
        Recall per class: [0.93, 0.92]
        F1 Score per class: [0.935, 0.92]

Suggested Improvement:
Since the metrics are strong, a small adjustment in hyperparameters:
def load_model():
    from sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesClassifier
    return ExtraTreesClassifier(n_estimators=1600, max_depth=70, min_samples_split=4, min_samples_leaf=2)


**Example 2** (Switch to XGBoost for Improved Performance):
Previous Model:
def load_model():
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    return RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=800, max_depth=50, min_samples_split=2, min_samples_leaf=1)

Metrics:
    Global:
        Accuracy: 0.92
        Precision: 0.92
        Recall: 0.92
        F1 Score: 0.92
    Per-Class:
        Precision per class: [0.95, 0.89]
        Recall per class: [0.90, 0.94]
        F1 Score per class: [0.92, 0.91]

Extra Info:

Suggested Improvement:
Switch to a more powerful model like XGBoost for improved performance:
def load_model():
    from xgboost import XGBClassifier
    return XGBClassifier(n_estimators=500, max_depth=10, learning_rate=0.05, subsample=0.8)


**Example 3** (Class Imbalance with Underperforming Class):
Previous Model:
def load_model():
    from sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesClassifier
    return ExtraTreesClassifier(n_estimators=1200, max_depth=60, min_samples_split=2, min_samples_leaf=1)

Metrics:
    Global:
        Accuracy: 0.85
        Precision: 0.80
        Recall: 0.78
        F1 Score: 0.79
    Per-Class:
        Precision per class: [0.90, 0.60]
        Recall per class: [0.92, 0.50]
        F1 Score per class: [0.91, 0.55]

Extra Info:
Binary classification problem with a class imbalance: there are 4 times more instances of class 0 than class 1.

Suggested Improvement:
Given the class imbalance, we suggest using XGBoost with a custom `scale_pos_weight` parameter to penalize the majority class (class 0) and better handle the minority class (class 1). Further exploration of additional metrics (like AUC) could be included. Adding some regularization can also prevent overfitting due to imbalance.:
def load_model():
    from xgboost import XGBClassifier
    return XGBClassifier(n_estimators=1000, max_depth=10, learning_rate=0.1, scale_pos_weight=4, reg_alpha=0.2, eval_metric='auc')

Explanation:
The `scale_pos_weight=4` parameter adjusts the model's sensitivity to class 1 by weighting its misclassification more heavily. This will help address the class imbalance and improve recall for the minority class.

**Example 4** (Noisy Labels):
Previous Model:
def load_model():
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    return RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=800, max_depth=50, min_samples_split=2, min_samples_leaf=1)

Metrics:
    Global:
        Accuracy: 0.92
        Precision: 0.92
        Recall: 0.92
        F1 Score: 0.92
    Per-Class:
        Precision per class: [0.90, 0.94]
        Recall per class: [0.88, 0.96]
        F1 Score per class: [0.89, 0.95]

Extra Info:

There are doubts about the accuracy of some class labels. It is suspected that up to 15% of the labels might be noisy or incorrect.

Suggested Improvement:
Use XGBoost with regularization (via gamma) to reduce the impact of noisy labels, and adjust scale_pos_weight to account for class imbalance. Adding regularization like reg_alpha or reg_lambda can enhance model robustness against noise. Additionally, using subsampling can reduce overfitting.:
def load_model():
    from xgboost import XGBClassifier
    return XGBClassifier(n_estimators=800, max_depth=10, learning_rate=0.1, gamma=0.5, subsample=0.8, reg_alpha=0.3, reg_lambda=0.3)


Explanation:
Using `gamma=0.5` in XGBoost increases regularization, making the model more robust to noisy labels. It helps by preventing overfitting to potentially mislabeled instances.

**Example 5** (Class Imbalance and Noisy Labels):
Previous Model:
def load_model():
    from sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesClassifier
    return ExtraTreesClassifier(n_estimators=1000, max_depth=40)

Metrics:
    Global:
        Accuracy: 0.89
        Precision: 0.88
        Recall: 0.85
        F1 Score: 0.86
    Per-Class:
        Precision per class: [0.90, 0.75]
        Recall per class: [0.88, 0.60]
        F1 Score per class: [0.89, 0.67]

Extra Info:
Class imbalance is present, with class 0 being 3 times more frequent than class 1. Additionally, there are concerns about the accuracy of some labels.

Suggested Improvement:
Use XGBoost with regularization (via gamma) to reduce the impact of noisy labels and adjust scale_pos_weight to account for class imbalance. Further fine-tuning with reg_lambda (L2 regularization) and subsample can provide better handling of both class imbalance and noisy labels:
def load_model():
    from xgboost import XGBClassifier
    return XGBClassifier(n_estimators=500, max_depth=15, learning_rate=0.05, scale_pos_weight=3, eval_metric='auc', gamma=0.5, reg_lambda=0.2, subsample=0.85)

Explanation:
This approach combines class balancing via `scale_pos_weight=3` and robustness to noisy labels via `gamma=0.5`. The model will better handle both issues simultaneously.

**Example 6** (Custom Huber Loss Function for Outliers):
Previous Model:
def load_model():
    from xgboost import XGBClassifier
    return XGBClassifier(n_estimators=500, max_depth=10, learning_rate=0.05)

Metrics:
	Global:
	    Accuracy: 0.89
	    Precision: 0.88
	    Recall: 0.85
	    F1 Score: 0.86
	Per-Class:
	    Precision per class: [0.90, 0.75]
	    Recall per class: [0.88, 0.60]
	    F1 Score per class: [0.89, 0.67]

Extra Info: There are several outliers in the data affecting the model’s performance, particularly in Class 1. We want to reduce the impact of these outliers and improve the performance of Class 1.

Suggested Improvement: To better handle outliers, use XGBoost’s built-in reg:squaredlogerror loss function, which can naturally reduce the influence of large residuals, providing a more robust solution than a custom Huber loss:
def load_model():
    from xgboost import XGBClassifier
    return XGBClassifier(n_estimators=600, max_depth=12, learning_rate=0.03, subsample=0.85, reg_alpha=0.2, objective='reg:squaredlogerror')
    
Explanation:

    Per-Class Metrics: Class 1 is underperforming due to outliers. To improve performance, we reduce the sensitivity of the model to these outliers.
    Loss Function: Instead of a custom Huber loss, we leverage the reg:squaredlogerror objective in XGBoost, which is well-suited to handle outliers by emphasizing smaller residuals and reducing the impact of large ones. This provides a more streamlined solution, eliminating the need for custom loss functions.
    Tuning: Additional improvements include increasing the number of estimators and adjusting subsample and reg_alpha to control overfitting and further improve performance for the underperforming class.

This approach simplifies outlier handling and improves Class 1 performance while maintaining the model’s robustness.


** Example 7 ** (Improvement Based on Performance Evolution Across Multiple Models):

Previous Model 1:
def load_model():
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    return LogisticRegression(C=1.0, max_iter=100)

Metrics for Model 1:

        Recall per class: [0.92, 0.78]
        F1 Score per class: [0.91, 0.81]

Previous Model 3:
def load_model():
    from xgboost import XGBClassifier
    return XGBClassifier(n_estimators=400, max_depth=10, learning_rate=0.05, scale_pos_weight=2)

Metrics for Model 3:
    Global:
        Accuracy: 0.90
        Precision: 0.89
        Recall: 0.88
        F1 Score: 0.88
    Per-Class:
        Precision per class: [0.92, 0.86]
        Recall per class: [0.93, 0.83]
        F1 Score per class: [0.92, 0.84]

Extra Info:
    The target dataset shows a moderate class imbalance (class 1 is twice as frequent as class 0).
    Performance improvement is needed for the minority class (class 0), as its recall has remained lower compared to the majority class in all three models.
    The model has consistently improved overall, but there is a diminishing return in precision and recall gains after switching to XGBoost (Model 3).

Suggested Improvement: Considering the history of model performance, particularly the diminishing returns in the minority class performance (Class 0), and given that class imbalance has been an issue, we suggest continuing with XGBoost but applying advanced hyperparameter tuning and early stopping to prevent overfitting while maximizing gains for the minority class:
def load_model():
    from xgboost import XGBClassifier
    return XGBClassifier(
        n_estimators=600,          # Increase number of estimators
        max_depth=12,              # Slightly deeper tree to capture more complex patterns
        learning_rate=0.03,        # Lower learning rate for fine-tuning
        subsample=0.85,            # Subsample to prevent overfitting
        colsample_bytree=0.8,      # Reduce tree feature sampling to improve generalization
        scale_pos_weight=2.5,      # Adjust further for class imbalance
        gamma=0.3,                 # Introduce regularization to control overfitting
        eval_metric='auc',         # Use AUC to monitor model performance during training
        early_stopping_rounds=50   # Stop training if no improvement in AUC after 50 rounds
    )

Explanation:

    Patterns in Performance: Model 1 (Logistic Regression) showed poor performance, particularly for the minority class (Class 0), which was somewhat improved by Model 2 (Random Forest) due to its ability to capture more complex interactions. However, even Model 2 showed a notable drop in recall for the minority class, indicating a class imbalance issue. The switch to XGBoost in Model 3 provided gains, especially for the majority class (Class 1), but improvements for the minority class are slowing down, suggesting a plateau in performance.

    Class Imbalance Tuning: We adjust the scale_pos_weight parameter slightly to 2.5 to further balance the importance of minority class misclassifications, while fine-tuning other hyperparameters to avoid overfitting and maintain generalization.

    Regularization and Subsampling: Introducing gamma=0.3 and adjusting the subsample and colsample_bytree parameters help prevent overfitting to specific patterns in the majority class, allowing the model to generalize better.

    Learning Rate and Early Stopping: Lowering the learning rate ensures that the model makes smaller, more refined updates, while early stopping is introduced to prevent overfitting when no further gains are seen in the AUC.

By leveraging the history of the previous models and their incremental improvements, this approach seeks to fine-tune XGBoost further while addressing the plateau observed in minority class performance.

        n_estimators=600,

        scale_pos_weight=1.5,  # Balances class weights
        boosting_type='gbdt'
    )

Analysis and Rationale for Suggested Improvement:
    Model Evolution: From Logistic Regression (Model 1) to Random Forest (Model 2), there was a significant jump in performance, especially for the minority class (class 1). Switching to XGBoost (Model 3) further improved both global and per-class metrics, but the improvement was less pronounced compared to the previous step.
    Challenges: The performance improvements are starting to plateau, and further optimization is needed to address the persistent gap between the two classes (class 0 and class 1), particularly in their recall and F1 scores.
    Proposed Model: LightGBM is proposed as the next step due to its capability to handle large datasets efficiently, faster training times, and powerful handling of imbalanced datasets through parameter tuning (e.g., is_unbalance or scale_pos_weight).

    from xgboost import XGBClassifier
    from lightgbm import LGBMClassifier
    from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    
    # Define base models
    base_models = [
        ('xgb', XGBClassifier(n_estimators=300, max_depth=8, learning_rate=0.05, subsample=0.8)),

    )
    return model

Rationale

This stacking ensemble combines the strengths of XGBoost and LightGBM, leveraging their complementary abilities to handle feature interactions and high-cardinality features. Logistic Regression is used as the meta-learner to combine predictions from the base models effectively. Cross-validation in stacking ensures robust generalization, and the approach directly addresses the challenges of imbalanced classes and diminishing performance gains from individual models.
